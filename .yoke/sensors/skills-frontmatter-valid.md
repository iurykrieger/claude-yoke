Frontmatter rewritten to new schema: type / token_cost / time_cost

(class / tier / applies_to / runs) removed. Body shape: How to run

## How to run

Run the `command:` declared in the frontmatter. The command is
a deterministic shell invocation; non-zero exit equals sensor
fail. See the source PRD for the calibrated invocation context.

## Known issues

- No known caveats yet — populated by `/yoke:consolidate-sensors`.

## Frequent errors

- TODO: pattern: TODO — fix.
