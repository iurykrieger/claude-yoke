# Sprint contracts

> Co-written by the Implementation Agent and the Validation Agent
> when they reach consensus on a sub-objective interpretation.
> Sprint contracts can refine the Acceptance Contract envelope but
> never relax it. A contract that contradicts the Acceptance Contract
> pauses the loop for human arbitration (Trigger 4 in Sprint 6+; in
> v0.4.0 the loop pauses with a clear message).
